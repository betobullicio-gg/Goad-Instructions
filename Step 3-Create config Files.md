Now you will need to create the files that terraform will use to define the values of the installation like the provider for example.

-  First: goad config

Create the directory

```
mkdir -p ~/.goad
```

Create the file

```
nano ~/.goad/goad.ini
```

In the nano file establish the following values:
(you need to change the region and profile to match yours)

```
[global]
provider = aws

[default]
lab = GOAD
region = eu-west-3
name_prefix = goad

[aws]
aws_region = eu-west-3
aws_zone   = eu-west-3c
profile = goad
key_name = goad-key
bastion_allowed_cidr = 0.0.0.0/0
```

You need to ctrl+o and then hit enter to save the changes and the ctrl+x to save and exit the nano file.

Then the configuration for the profile file, this is were the script will grab the keys generated by the user in step 1 so it can access the instance and deploy all the infrastructure with the console.

```
aws configure --profile goad
```

It will ask for the access and secret keys for the user, use your keys to fill as requested.

```
AWS Access Key ID: your-key
AWS Secret Access Key: your-secret-key
Default region name: eu-west-3 (use your region)
Default output format: json
```

With this all the requirements are satisfy and you can start the installation process.
